# Environmental Due Diligence Services

At GeoFront, we offer comprehensive environmental due diligence services to help you navigate the complexities of environmental regulations and ensure sustainable project development. Our in-house team includes fully registered lead experts with the National Environmental Management Authority (NEMA). Together with our partners, we aim to deliver full-cycle, one-house EIA/EA services, ensuring all necessary measures are in place for NEMA audit reports. This includes helping clients acquire essential documentation related to effluent discharge, air quality, and disposal certificates, demonstrating compliance with environmental quality standards and ensuring your facility’s operations do not harm the environment.

## Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) and Assessment Audits (EA)

Our EIA/EA services involve a detailed evaluation of the potential environmental effects of your proposed projects. This process helps in identifying, predicting, and mitigating adverse environmental impacts before project implementation. We ensure compliance with the Environmental Management and Co-ordination Act (EMCA), 1999, and the Environmental (Impact Assessment and Audit) Regulations, 2003. This ensures that environmental considerations are integrated into your planning and decision-making processes. We also comply with The Environment Laws (Amendment) Bill, 2024, which enhances the regulatory framework for environmental protection.

## Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA)

Building on the EIA, our ESIA services incorporate social impact assessments to ensure that both environmental and social risks are thoroughly evaluated. This holistic approach is essential for projects with significant social implications, such as community displacement or changes in local livelihoods. For carbon projects, we adhere to the Climate Change (Carbon Markets) Regulations, 2024, ensuring compliance with the latest standards in carbon market operations.

## Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA)

We utilize MCDA to evaluate multiple criteria and assess the environmental impact of different options. This structured decision-making tool helps balance various objectives and stakeholder interests, ensuring that all relevant factors are considered and weighted appropriately.

## Advanced Modeling Services

Our advanced modeling services use sophisticated computational models to simulate environmental scenarios. These models predict the potential impacts of various actions on the environment, such as changes in land use, water quality, air pollution, and climate change. This allows us to develop strategies to mitigate negative impacts and identify the most sustainable options.

## Comprehensive Documentation for NEMA Audit Reports

To ensure completeness and compliance with NEMA standards, we assist our clients in acquiring the following documentation through our partners:

- Effluent Discharge License and Monitoring Reports: We help you obtain a valid effluent discharge license issued by NEMA if your facility discharges waste into water bodies or sewers. We also assist in compiling recent effluent monitoring reports showing compliance with NEMA’s discharge limits (e.g., pH, chemical oxygen demand (COD), biological oxygen demand (BOD), total suspended solids, etc.).
- Air Quality Monitoring Reports and Stack Emission Data: If your operations emit pollutants into the atmosphere, we facilitate obtaining stack emission test results, detailing pollutants such as sulfur dioxide (SO₂), nitrogen oxides (NOₓ), particulate matter (PM), carbon monoxide (CO), and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). We also help you acquire valid air quality monitoring reports to demonstrate that ambient air standards are met, especially if the facility has combustion processes or other activities that impact air quality.
- Disposal Certificates for Hazardous and Non-Hazardous Waste: We assist in obtaining certificates from licensed waste handlers for hazardous waste, as NEMA mandates safe disposal of waste materials. For non-hazardous waste, we help you document the waste disposal method (e.g., recycling, landfill) and acquire any certificates from authorized disposal facilities.
- Noise Level Monitoring Reports: We help you compile noise monitoring data if applicable, especially for operations that produce significant noise. Data should show that noise levels comply with the Environmental Management and Coordination (Noise and Excessive Vibration Pollution) Control Regulations.
- Water Quality and Groundwater Reports: If your operations impact groundwater or surface water, we assist in obtaining quality monitoring reports indicating parameters such as pH, heavy metals, and microbial content, ensuring standards are met for water protection.
- Air Pollution Control Equipment Maintenance Records: We help you maintain records of maintenance for air pollution control equipment (e.g., scrubbers, filters, baghouses) to show they are functioning optimally to minimize emissions.
- Oil Spill Contingency Plans and Records: For facilities handling large quantities of oil or fuel, we assist in preparing records of spill management plans, including recent drills or training records, as well as any past spill incident records and responses.
- Environmental Liability Insurance or Bond (if applicable): Some facilities require financial assurance mechanisms like environmental liability insurance or bonds. We help you secure these to ensure you can address any environmental damages caused by your operations.
