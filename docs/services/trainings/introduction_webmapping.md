# Introduction to Webmapping Training
Web maps are online maps created using GIS applications that allow users to interact with geographic information organised into layers. These maps can be shared within your organisation and accessed on the web, smartphones, and tablets. Each web map includes a base map along with various additional data layers and tools for interacting with them. These tools can perform simple tasks, like opening pop-up windows, or more complex functions, such as conducting spatial analyses.
Geographic Information Systems (GIS) are widely recognised as essential tools for managing, analysing, and presenting large amounts of data, as well as supporting local planning activities.

## Learning this course will enable participants:
1.	Understanding Spatial Data Visualisation: Web mapping enables you to visualise spatial data interactively and attractively. You’ll learn how to create dynamic maps that effectively convey spatial patterns, relationships, and trends.
2.	Enhancing Decision-Making and Analysis: Web mapping allows you to conduct geospatial analyses and make informed decisions based on spatial data. This course will help you develop skills to analyse and interpret geospatial information, benefiting fields like urban planning, environmental management, marketing, and logistics.
3.	Sharing and Collaboration: Web mapping makes it easy to share and collaborate on spatial data and maps. You’ll learn how to publish and share your maps online, allowing others to access and interact with the information, fostering collaboration and informed decision-making among stakeholders.
4.	Enhancing Data Presentation: Web mapping offers powerful tools for presenting data in engaging and intuitive ways. You’ll discover how to effectively present spatial data through interactive maps, charts, and visualisations, making complex information more accessible.
5.	Exploring Career Opportunities: Being skilled in web mapping opens up various career paths. Many industries, such as urban planning, environmental science, logistics, marketing, and disaster management, need professionals who can analyse spatial data and create interactive maps. This expertise can enhance your job prospects and give you a competitive edge.
6.	Keeping Up with Technological Advancements: Web mapping technologies are continually evolving, with new tools, APIs, and frameworks emerging regularly. By studying web mapping, you’ll stay informed about the latest developments in the field and adapt to new technologies, ensuring you remain relevant in the dynamic world of geospatial data analysis and visualisation.
