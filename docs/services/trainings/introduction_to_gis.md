# Introduction to GIS and Mapping Training
Discover the basics of spatial analysis and mapping with Geographic Information Systems (GIS). In this course, you’ll learn beginner techniques using tools like QGIS and ArcGIS, which work on various platforms including Linux, Mac, Windows, and Android, and can handle different types of data formats.
GIS is a useful tool for managing and analyzing large amounts of data, as well as for local planning activities.

## About this Course
GIS helps you visualize and create information to make better decisions and solve problems. You’ll get an overview of the main parts of GIS and learn important concepts through hands-on experience with maps and geographic data.
