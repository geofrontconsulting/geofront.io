# Advance GIS and Mapping Training

Take your understanding of spatial analysis and mapping to the next level with Geographic Information Systems (GIS). GIS is a powerful tool for managing, analysing, and presenting large amounts of data, as well as assisting with various local planning tasks.
In this course, you'll learn advanced GIS techniques using software like QGIS and ArcGIS, which work on Linux, Unix, Mac OS X, Windows, and Android, and can handle a variety of vector, raster, and database formats.

## About this Course

This course is the second in the Geographic Information Systems (GIS) Specialisation and will provide you with a deeper understanding of common data types, such as raster and vector data, along with their structures, quality, and storage methods.

You’ll explore data models and formats in detail, focusing on vector and raster concepts. You’ll also learn how the scale of data affects analysis and how to load layers from web services.

You’ll create vector data models using attribute tables, write query strings, and define queries. You’ll also learn how to digitise new data and use the editing tools in QGIS and ArcGIS. The course will cover data management, cartography, spatial analysis, and the use of GIS servers.

Additionally, you’ll look into common data storage options like geodatabases and shapefiles, learning how to choose the right one for your projects and optimise them for performance. You’ll work with raster data for the first time, using digital elevation models and conducting slope and distance analyses.

It’s recommended that you have completed the introductory course, Introduction to GIS and Mapping, before taking this advanced course.

By finishing this second course in the specialisation, you’ll gain the skills needed to succeed in the full programme.
